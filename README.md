# Map Practice

This is a repository of maps and spatial projects by Lucia Johnson to keep track of my progress in map making.

## 5. Owls of Bavaria

This is a web mapping application that displays owl observations in Bavaria. I am building it in honor of my mother who is a big fan of birding, and especially owls.

* Tools used: **ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript**, **iNaturalist REST API**, **React**, **Redux**

## 4. B&B Complex Fires Vegetation Regrowth

This was the final project for my Remote Sensing II class at the University at Albany. The project analyzed the burn severity and the vegetation regrowth post-fire of the B&B complex fires in Oregon in 2003.

* Tools used: **ArcMap**, **Google Earth Engine**

## 3. New York Unemployment

I made this map at my place of employment. It was made as a presentation to a client in order to see if they would be interested in having more maps made to help further their goals.

* Tools used: **QGIS**

## 2. Buffalo Linden Trees

This is a map of all the Linden trees in Buffalo, NY. I got the idea for this map after watching [this video from the Black Forager](https://fb.watch/fexb8qlX45/) about how you can make something chocolate-like from the seed pods of the Linden tree. Tea made from Linden flowers is also one of my favorite teas. I wanted to make a map of areas where I could forage from Linden trees, ideally away from any major sources of pollution. It turns out that there are a LOT of Linden trees in Buffalo.

* Tools used: **ArcGIS Pro**
